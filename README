Dependencies:

-) set up settings_secret.py; use SqlLite database
-) Run development server with `./manage.py runserver`
-) install client deps with `yarn` in root directory
-) install webpack globally if it isn't with `yarn global add webpack` (webpack 2.5.1 works)
-) Build/watch webpack assets with `webpack -w` in base project directory

To manage the server in production:
